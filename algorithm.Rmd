#### Daily average price:
Pi = (Ci + Hi + Li)/3
where Ci, Hi and Li are the close, high, and low quotes for day i, respectively.

#### Set of k percentage variations of today's close to the following
k days average prices (often called arithmetic returns):
Vi = [(P(i+j) - Ci)/Ci]^k, j=1

#### Indicator variable 
is the total sum of the variations whose absolute value is above our target margin p%:Ti
The general idea of the variable T is to signal k-days periods that have
several days with average daily prices clearly above the target variation.

#### Predicting Stock Market Returns
Ri-h = (Ci - Ci-h)/Ci-h
where Ci is the Close price at session i.

#### BBands - (Bollinger Bands)
	prices are high at the upper band and low at the lower band

#### chaikinVolatility - (Chaikin Volatility)
	indicator depicts volatility by calculating the difference between the high and low for each period or trading bar. It measures the difference between two moving averages of a volume-weighted accumulation distribution line.

#### CLV (EMA) - (Close Location Value)
	The CLV ranges between +1 and -1, where a value of +1 means the close is equal to the high and a value of -1 means the close is equal to the day's low.

#### EMV - (Arms' Ease of Movement Value)
	highlights the relationship between volume and price changes and is particularly useful for assessing the strength of a trend.High positive values indicate the price is increasing on low volume: strong negative values indicate the price is dropping on low volume

#### MACD - (moving average convergence/divergence)
