<h4>Daily average price:</h4>

<p>Pi = (Ci + Hi + Li)/3
where Ci, Hi and Li are the close, high, and low quotes for day i, respectively.</p>

<h4>Set of k percentage variations of today&#39;s close to the following</h4>

<p>k days average prices (often called arithmetic returns):
Vi = [(P(i+j) - Ci)/Ci]<sup>k,</sup> j=1</p>

<h4>Indicator variable</h4>

<p>is the total sum of the variations whose absolute value is above our target margin p%:Ti
The general idea of the variable T is to signal k-days periods that have
several days with average daily prices clearly above the target variation.</p>

<h4>Predicting Stock Market Returns</h4>

<p>Ri-h = (Ci - Ci-h)/Ci-h
where Ci is the Close price at session i.</p>

<h2>Finacial Indicators</h2>

<h4>ATR - (average true range)</h4>

<pre><code>the degree of price volatility, is an N-day exponential moving average of the true range values. Wilder recommended a 14-period smoothing.
</code></pre>

<h4>SMI - (Stochastic Momentum Index)</h4>

<pre><code> the range between an assetÂ’s high and low price during a given period of time. The idea behind is that prices tend to close near the extremes of the recent range before turning points
</code></pre>

<h4>ADX - (Average Directional Movement Index)</h4>

<pre><code>an indicator of trend strength in a series of prices.The ADX does not indicate trend direction or momentum, only trend strength. ADX will range between 0 and 100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength.
</code></pre>

<h4>aroon - (Aroon indicator)</h4>

<pre><code>A technical indicator used for identifying trends. It is made up of two lines: one line is called &quot;Aroon up&quot;, which measures the strength of the uptrend, and the other line is called &quot;Aroon down&quot;, which measures the downtrend. The indicator reports the time it is taking for the price to reach, from a starting point, the highest and lowest points over a given time period, each reported as a percentage of total time.
</code></pre>

<h4>BBands - (Bollinger Bands)</h4>

<pre><code>prices are high at the upper band and low at the lower band
</code></pre>

<h4>chaikinVolatility - (Chaikin Volatility)</h4>

<pre><code>indicator depicts volatility by calculating the difference between the high and low for each period or trading bar. It measures the difference between two moving averages of a volume-weighted accumulation distribution line.
</code></pre>

<h4>CLV (EMA) - (Close Location Value)</h4>

<pre><code>The CLV ranges between +1 and -1, where a value of +1 means the close is equal to the high and a value of -1 means the close is equal to the day&#39;s low.
</code></pre>

<h4>EMV - (Arms&#39; Ease of Movement Value)</h4>

<pre><code>highlights the relationship between volume and price changes and is particularly useful for assessing the strength of a trend.High positive values indicate the price is increasing on low volume: strong negative values indicate the price is dropping on low volume
</code></pre>

<h4>MACD - (moving average convergence/divergence)</h4>

By comparing EMAs of different lengths, the MACD series gauges changes in the trend of a stock. The difference between the MACD series and its average is claimed to reveal subtle shifts in the strength and direction of a stock&#39;s trend.
</code></pre>

<h4>MFI - (Money Flow Index)</h4>

<pre><code>ranges from 0 to 100. It is used to show the money flow (an approximation of the dollar value of a day&#39;s trading) over several days. measure the &quot;enthusiasm&quot; of the market. In other words, the Money flow index shows how much a stock was traded.A value of 80 or more is generally considered overbought, a value of 20 or less oversold.
</code></pre>

<h4>SAR - (Parabolic Stop-and-Reverse)</h4>
